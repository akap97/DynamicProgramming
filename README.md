# DynamicProgramming

#### 1) EditDistance: The goal of this problem is to implement the algorithm for computing the edit distance between two strings.

#### 2) LCS2: Given two sequences A = (a1 , a2 , . . . , an ) and B = (b1, b2 , . . . , bm), find the length of their longest common subsequence, i.e., the largest non-negative integer p such that there exist indices 1 ≤ i1 < i2 < · · · < ip ≤ n and 1 ≤ j1 < j2 < · · · < jp ≤ m, such that ai1 = bj1 , . . . , aip = bjp .

#### 3) LCS3: Given three sequences A = (a1 , a2 , . . . , an ), B = (b1 , b2 , . . . , bm ), and C = (c1 , c2, . . . , cl ), find the length of their longest common subsequence, i.e., the largest non-negative integer p such that there exist indices 1 ≤ i1 < i2 < · · · < ip ≤ n, 1 ≤ j1 < j2 < · · · < jp ≤ m, 1 ≤ k1 < k2 < · · · < kp ≤ l such that ai1 = bj1 = ck1 , . . . , aip = bjp = ckp

#### 4) moneyChangeDP: As we already know, a natural greedy strategy for the change problem does not work correctly for any set of denominations. For example, if the available denominations are 1, 3, and 4, the greedy algorithm will change 6 cents using three coins (4 + 1 + 1) while it can be changed using just two coins (3 + 3). Your goal now is to apply dynamic programming for solving the Money Change Problem for denominations 1, 3, and 4.

#### 5) primitiveCal: You are given a primitive calculator that can perform the following three operations with the current number x: multiply x by 2, multiply x by 3, or add 1 to x. Your goal is given a positive integer n, find the minimum number of operations needed to obtain the number n starting from the number 1.

#### 6) MatrixMul: Given a chain of n matrices A0 , . . . , An−1 to be multiplied, minimizie total cost of multiplication.

#### 7) Knapsack_noRepeat:  Given n gold bars, find the maximum weight of gold that fits into a bag of capacity W .

#### 8) 3EqualPartition: You and two of your friends have just returned back home after visiting various countries. Now you would like to evenly split all the souvenirs that all three of you bought. The first line contains an integer n. The second line contains integers v1 , v2 , . . . , vn separated by spaces.

#### 9) SubsetSum: Given a set of non-negative integers, and a value sum, determine if there is a subset of the given set with sum equal to given sum.

#### 10) Parenthization: Find the maximum value of an arithmetic expression by specifying the order of applying its arithmetic operations using additional parentheses.
